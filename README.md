TimedCraft 0.1
==========

A server-side Minecraft mod that limits a player's playtime to a configurable amount in a 24-hour period. Built with the Forge API, tested against Minecraft 1.6.4.

I wrote TimedCraft to help manage my predilection towards excessively long play sessions. Since I would like to maintain some degree of control over my life, I needed a very light-weight 

TimedCraft is explicitly designed to be a pain in the ass to configure. I run my own server (and am thus admin on it), and I do not want to be able to easily modify my own playtime.

Configuration
==========

Drop a TimedCraft.cfg into the /config directory in your server installation. Config files contain username/time-per-day pairs. Times are in milliseconds. A sample config is included in the directory.

License
==========

TimedCraft is open-source and freely redistributable. If you use TimedCraft, either in whole or in part, I do require that you please credit me for the mod as "Jeff Sult (blastron)".

Support
==========

TimedCraft is released as-is. This is a mod developed for my personal use, and I am releasing it to the public mostly for vanity's sake. If you find an issue with the mod, please feel free to let me know, but please also understand that if it's an issue that I am not likely to personally encounter (such as a compatibility problem with a mod that I don't use), I most likely will not fix it.
